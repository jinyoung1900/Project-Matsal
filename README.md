# Project-Matsal

App project for Korea to save perfectly good food going to waste. Inspired by ResQ and TooGoodToGo. Props to my brother for the original idea. 

# Matsal (맛살)

Matsal is a food rescue and surprise meal app for Korea. Inspired by food waste reduction platforms like Too Good To Go, Matsal helps local restaurants and stores reduce waste by offering leftover or surplus meals to users at discounted prices.
In Korean, Matsal is also the name of imitation crab meat, and it literally means "flavored flesh" or "tasty meat". I also named it that way since I like food.
